# Changelog - Claude Code APM Integration

All notable changes to the APM framework for Claude Code optimization are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-06

### Changed (Major Revision)

#### Multi-Agent Architecture Preserved
- **Reverted to multi-agent design**: Each Claude Code instance operates as a separate agent
- **Rationale**: Leverages ability to run multiple Claude Code instances for true parallel work
- **Architecture**: Manager Agent (Instance 1) coordinates Implementation Agents (Instances 2, 3, 4...)

### Updated

#### Slash Command System (`CLAUDE.md: lines 26-99`)
- **Agent Initialization**: `/apm-init [role]` to establish agent type per instance
- **Manager Commands**: `/manager` with role-specific operations
- **Implementation Commands**: `/implement` for task execution
- **Cross-Agent Commands**: `/apm-sync` for state synchronization

#### Inter-Agent Communication (`CLAUDE.md: lines 276-291`)
- Manager → Implementation via task prompts
- Implementation → Manager via Memory Bank logs
- Implementation ↔ Implementation via Memory Bank coordination

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-06 (Initial Release)

### Added

#### Core Claude Code Integration
- **Slash Command System** (`CLAUDE.md: lines 35-84`)
  - `/apm-init` command for agent role initialization
  - `/manager` command with sub-commands: discover, plan, assign, review, handover
  - `/implement` command for task execution operations
  - `/task-prompt` command for generating Implementation Agent assignments
  - `/load-task` command for parsing task assignments
  - `/memory` command for Memory Bank operations
  - `/apm-status` command for role-aware project overview
  - `/apm-context` command for context window management
  - `/apm-sync` command for project state synchronization

#### Enhanced Multi-Agent Architecture (`CLAUDE.md: lines 11-24`)
- Preserved APM's multi-agent system with Claude Code enhancements
- Each Claude Code instance operates as dedicated agent
- Memory Bank serves as shared communication hub
- File-based persistence for true asynchronous work

#### Claude Code Specific Features (`CLAUDE.md: lines 200-225`)
- **Agent Awareness**: Role initialization and maintenance per instance
- **Efficient Task Distribution**: Manager generates Claude-ready prompts
- **Synchronized Logging**: Agent-identified timestamps and format compliance
- **Handover Automation**: Role-specific templates and state preservation

#### New Directory Structure (`CLAUDE.md: lines 173-198`)
- Added `.apm/` configuration directory
  - `agents/` for tracking individual agent states
  - `context/` for saved context states per agent
  - `templates/` for custom prompt templates
- Enhanced `Handover/` structure with role-specific directories

#### Workflow Optimizations (`CLAUDE.md: lines 101-145`)
- Multi-instance project initialization flow
- Task assignment with clipboard integration
- Review cycle with synchronization
- Specialized agent integration patterns

### Enhanced

#### Context Window Management (`CLAUDE.md: lines 161-165`)
- Per-agent context tracking
- Handover protocols for agent replacement
- Context artifacts organized by agent role
- Recovery procedures for context loss

#### Memory Bank Integration (`CLAUDE.md: lines 155-159`)
- Single source of truth for all agents
- Standardized format across agents
- Validation to prevent drift
- Conflict detection for simultaneous edits

#### Error Handling (`CLAUDE.md: lines 304-326`)
- Agent role confusion recovery
- Memory Bank conflict resolution
- Context limit handling per agent
- Sync issue troubleshooting

### Documentation

#### Usage Examples (`CLAUDE.md: lines 226-265`)
- Multi-agent interaction patterns
- Manager initialization and discovery
- Implementation task reception
- Cross-agent synchronization

#### Best Practices (`CLAUDE.md: lines 267-274`)
- Agent role initialization requirements
- Synchronization frequency recommendations
- Manager coordination principles
- Proactive handover preparation

#### Inter-Agent Communication (`CLAUDE.md: lines 276-291`)
- Clear communication pathways
- Task assignment protocols
- Work logging standards
- Boundary maintenance

## Implementation Details

### Key Design Decisions

#### Multi-Agent Preservation
- **Maintains original APM strength**: True parallel work capability
- **Leverages Claude Code feature**: Multiple instance support
- **Enables specialization**: Different agents for different expertise

#### Slash Commands for Coordination
- **Role establishment**: `/apm-init` ensures clear agent identity
- **State management**: `/apm-sync` keeps agents aligned
- **Task flow**: `/task-prompt` and `/load-task` streamline handoffs

#### File-Based Communication
- **Memory Bank as hub**: All agents read/write to shared files
- **Persistence**: Work survives instance termination
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail of all agent actions

### Advantages Over Single-Instance

1. **True Parallelism**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
2. **Specialization**: Agents can have different contexts/expertise
3. **Fault Tolerance**: One agent failure doesn't stop project
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Reduced context pollution between tasks
5. **Scalability**: Add more agents as project grows

## Migration Guide

For users adopting Claude Code APM:

1. **Initialize Agents Properly**
   - Start each instance with `/apm-init [role]`
   - Manager Agent should be Instance 1

2. **Use Task Prompts**
   - Manager: `/task-prompt task-id`
   - Implementation: `/load-task clipboard`

3. **Synchronize Regularly**
   - All agents: `/apm-sync` before major operations
   - Especially important before Memory Bank updates

4. **Leverage Persistence**
   - Work is saved in files, not just context
   - Can resume after closing instances

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:
- Agent discovery protocol (find active agents)
- Automated task distribution based on agent availability
- Real-time collaboration features
- Performance metrics per agent
- Visual project dashboard

## Notes

- All line number references are to the updated CLAUDE.md file
- Original APM multi-agent architecture preserved and enhanced
- Commands designed for multi-instance coordination
- File-based approach ensures persistence and async work
