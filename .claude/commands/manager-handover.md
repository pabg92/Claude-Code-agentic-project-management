# Manager Agent - Prepare Handover Documentation

As a Manager Agent, you will now prepare comprehensive handover documentation. This ensures seamless continuity when transitioning to a new Manager Agent instance.

## Handover Preparation Process

### 1. Current State Assessment
Document the current project status:
- **Completed Phases**: What's been accomplished

### 2. Create Handover Artifact

Create a structured handover document in `Handover/Manager/[timestamp]_Manager_Handover.md`:

```markdown
