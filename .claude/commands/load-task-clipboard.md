- **Dependencies**: What must be complete first
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to measure completion

### 2. Validate Assignment
Ensure the assignment includes:
- [ ] Clear task identification
- [ ] Specific deliverables
- [ ] Technical requirements

### 3. Set Up Task Context
After loading:
1. Confirm task details are understood
