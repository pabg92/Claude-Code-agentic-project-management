# Implementation Agent - Start Task

As an Implementation Agent, you will now begin work on your assigned task. Ensure you have loaded the task assignment before proceeding.

## Pre-Start Checklist

Before starting, verify:
- [ ] Task assignment has been loaded (`/load-task`)
- [ ] You understand the requirements
- [ ] Dependencies are met
- [ ] You have access to necessary resources

## Task Initiation Process

### 1. Confirm Task Understanding
Review and confirm:
- **Task ID & Name**: What you're implementing
- **Objectives**: What needs to be achieved
- **Deliverables**: What you'll produce
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to measure completion

### 2. Set Up Work Environment
- Create necessary directories/files
- Set up development environment
- Prepare testing framework if needed
- Initialize version control if required

### 3. Create Initial Memory Bank Entry

Log the start of work in `Memory/Phase_X/Task_X.X_Log.md`:

```markdown
# Task X.X: [Task Name] - Implementation Log

## Task Start
- **Date**: [Current date/time]
- **Agent**: Implementation Agent [Identifier]
- **Status**: Started

## Task Overview
[Brief restatement of task objectives]

## Implementation Approach
[Your planned approach to complete the task]

## Progress Log
### [Timestamp] - Task Initiated
- Reviewed requirements
- Set up environment
- Planning implementation approach
```

### 4. Plan Your Approach
Document your implementation strategy:
- Break down into subtasks
- Identify potential challenges
- Plan testing approach
- Consider edge cases

### 5. Begin Implementation
Start working on the task:
- Follow the technical specifications
- Use recommended approaches from guiding notes
- Implement incrementally
- Test as you go

## During Implementation

### Regular Progress Updates
Log progress at key milestones:
```markdown
### [Timestamp] - [Milestone]
- What was completed
- Decisions made
- Code implemented
- Tests written
- Any issues encountered
```

### Code Documentation
When logging code:
```markdown
### Implementation: [Component Name]
```[language]
[Your code here]
```
**Purpose**: [What this code does]
**Key Decisions**: [Why implemented this way]
```

### Handling Blockers
If you encounter blockers:
1. Document the issue clearly
2. Log attempted solutions
3. Update task status
4. Request Manager assistance

### Testing Progress
Document testing:
```markdown
### Testing: [Test Type]
- Test case: [Description]
- Result: [Pass/Fail]
- Notes: [Any observations]
```

## Best Practices
- Commit work frequently
- Document decisions as you make them
- Follow project coding standards
- Write tests alongside code
- Keep the Memory Bank updated
- Ask for clarification when needed

## Task Status Tracking
Update your status regularly:
- **Started**: Beginning work
- **In Progress**: Actively working
- **Testing**: Writing/running tests
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies
- **Review Ready**: Complete, needs review

Begin implementing your assigned task and remember to log your progress regularly.
